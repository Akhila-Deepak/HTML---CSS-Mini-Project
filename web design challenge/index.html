    <p>Life in a city is a really busy life. People who live in big cities, they are always busy. Some of them are busy with their business and some of them are busy with their job. In the morning, in a big city, you will find people doing morning walk or exercise. A few hours later traffic becomes heavier than morning and people start to come out.</p>
